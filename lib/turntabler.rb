    # Sets up the proper EventMachine reactor / Fiber to run commands against a
    # client.  If this is not in interactive mode, then the block won't return
    # until the EventMachine reactor is stopped.

    # @note If you're already running within an EventMachine reactor *and* a
    # Fiber, then there's no need to call this method prior to interacting with
    # a Turntabler::Client instance.
    # @example
    #   # Non-interactive, not in reactor / fiber
    #   Turntabler.run do
    #     client = Turntabler::Client.new(...)
    #     client.room.become_dj

    #   # Interactive, not in reactor / fiber
    #   Turntabler.interactive
    #   Turntabler.run do
    #     @client = ...
    #   end
    #   Turntabler.run do
    #     @client.room.become_dj
    #     # ...
    #   end
    #   
    #   # Non-interactive, already in reactor / fiber
    #   client = Turntabler::Client(...)
    #   client.room.become_dj
    # 
    # @example DSL
    #   # Takes the same arguments as Turntabler::Client
    #   Turntabler.run(EMAIL, PASSWORD, :room => ROOM) do
    #     room.become_dj
